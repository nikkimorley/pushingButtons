# Pushing Buttons
What started as a offhand remark in a conversation turned into a rabbit hole...

This is just a silly thought experiment to see if I can write some functions to calculate how many possible combinations of buttons I could push assuming someone had a set number of buttons to push.

Ya know... to annoy someone.

I'll make a UI eventually. It'll have a giant red button.
